# ABB Software Engineer Task 2 

### I created the algorithm of Task 2 via Javascript language. I used Recursion and some Javascript methods including ES6+ methods. I created HTML and Javascript files and the value returned from Javascript are shown in the HTML file. So opening an HTML file is enough for returned value but the main algorithms for this task are placed in a Javascript file called Task2-js.js
